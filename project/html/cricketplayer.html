                <p>Perry was born and raised in the Sydney suburb of Wahroonga, attending Beecroft Primary School and Pymble Ladies' College.[10][11] She was Sports, Athletics, and Cricket Captain at Pymble.[12][13] During her school years, she played a range of sports beside cricket and soccer, such as tennis, athletics, touch football and golf. She became friends with future Australian teammate Alyssa Healy at the age of nine, and they played cricket together throughout childhood.[14] Healy occasionally referred to her as "Dags" because of an ill-fitting uniform she wore at junior level,[14] though Perry is more commonly known by the nickname "Pez".[15][16]
